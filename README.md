# AFK Control

Sometimes you need to unlock your laptop and go away, but you don't want anyone to access or mess around with your
laptop!
This program is for you, it can help you manage afk with a single shortcut and make sure no-one can access your laptop

## How it works

It creates a file in your `$HOME` directory named `.afk` then after you press `afka` (it means: away from keyboard
active) then it lock the keyboard and mouse! also it takes screenshot if someone tries to mess around.

Every screenshot and logs are found in `.afk` directory.

**NOTE: only works on macOS**
